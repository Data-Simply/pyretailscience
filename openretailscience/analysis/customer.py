"""Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis for Retention and Value Optimization.

## Business Context

Understanding customer purchase patterns is fundamental to retail success. Some customers
make single purchases and never return, while others become loyal repeat buyers. This
module analyzes the distribution of purchase frequency to identify customer behavior
segments and inform retention strategies.

## The Business Problem

Retailers need to understand the relationship between customer purchase frequency and
business performance:
- What percentage of customers are one-time buyers versus repeat customers?
- How does purchase frequency relate to customer lifetime value?
- Which customer segments offer the greatest growth opportunities?

Without this analysis, businesses may invest equally in all customers or fail to
identify high-potential segments for targeted retention efforts.

## Real-World Applications

### Customer Retention Strategy
- Identify the percentage of one-time buyers for targeted reactivation campaigns
- Segment customers by purchase frequency for differentiated marketing approaches
- Develop loyalty programs based on actual behavior patterns

### Resource Allocation
- Focus retention efforts on customers showing repeat purchase potential
- Allocate customer service resources based on customer value segments
- Optimize marketing spend by targeting high-frequency customer characteristics

### Business Performance Monitoring
- Track changes in purchase frequency distribution over time
- Monitor the health of customer acquisition versus retention balance
- Identify shifts in customer behavior that may indicate market changes

This module computes purchase-frequency statistics that can be visualized with
the plotting helpers in `openretailscience.plots`.
