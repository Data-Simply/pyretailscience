## Impact Metrics

These additions address:
- **39.4%** of comments (Testing + Test Structure)
- **18.2%** of comments (PR Scope)
- **18.2%** of comments (Code Quality/Vectorization)
- **3.0%** of comments (API Design)
- **3.0%** of comments (Documentation)

**Total: ~82%** of all human review comments would be addressed by these guidelines.

## Quick-Start: Minimal Changes

If you want minimal changes, just add these three key rules to existing sections:

1. **In "Test Writing Guidelines"**, add:
   > "Prefer pandas `assert_frame_equal` with expected dataframes rather than multiple `iloc` assertions"

2. **In "Code Style Guidelines"**, add:
   > "Use pandas/numpy vectorized operations instead of loops (e.g., `df.columns.astype(str).to_list()` not `[str(x) for x in df.columns]`)"

3. **Add new section before committing**:
   > "## Before Committing
   > - Remove unused imports and files not related to the PR's core purpose
   > - Remove tests that don't verify actual behavior
   > - Consider making hardcoded values into optional parameters"

These three additions alone would address ~60% of review comments.
